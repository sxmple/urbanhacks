<p> <h6> Our main purpose for this app was to make the tourist's experience and your experience of Hamilton more streamlined, and fun! We have thought and made several factors that are developed in our app, such as what's nearby, and bookmarks, and such. </p> </h6>

<p> <h6> We used Google Cloud Platform to integrate the open-source Maps API (really useful).
The implementation we approached with the API is to use filters to locate nearby businesses on our app. </p> </h6>


<p> <h6> Our app heavily ties into the urban development of Hamilton, as a section of it depends on tourism! </p> </h6>
